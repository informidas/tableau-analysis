In the winter months there is also alot more rentals around 5pm which is to be expected with an earlier sunset. An even more interesting trend is that there are more rentals in the winter, especially in the peak periods.This could be a factor of people wanting to avoid walking in colder temperatures, as well as in the summer months - a lot more people take vacation / travel. <br/>

## Customer Types
While Subscriptions account for the lionshare of the bike rental market, the short-term Customer base is growing at a faster rate. This could be a result of market saturation for subscriptions or that customers find the pay-as-you-go model to be more cost-effective for their needs. Either way, this warrants further investigation <br />
